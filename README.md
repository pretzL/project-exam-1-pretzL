[Food For Thought](https://pretzl-fft.netlify.app/index.html) is a food blog I created for my Project Exam 1 at Noroff.

## Description

Food For Thought was originally created for my Project Exam 1 at Noroff. Since then, it has become a site where me and my friends add recipes and food tips which we find useful in order to more easily share them between us. Food For Thought is built with vanilla JavaScript and uses WordPress as a headless CMS in order to store content. It's built to be a fully responsive across any screen size and uses a mix of categorization in order to display relevant content based on user input.

The main features are:

- Fully responsive
- WordPress CMS
- Completely based on vanilla JavaScript
- Search element
- Future-proofed blog-list element

## Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
